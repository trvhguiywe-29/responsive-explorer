WorldGamingCommunity: A website where people can make blog posts and submit them to get them onto the website.
External technology:
1. Bootstrap: Jumbotrons are used for the headers and blogposts as well as the main content of the website itself.
2. JQuery: Used for all of the scripts in the website

To improve this website, I would add an actual search bar, and full versions of the articles, since they were supposed to be shortened versions when I made them. Those would be pretty hard to make for someone at an intermediate level, so I didn't add them.
